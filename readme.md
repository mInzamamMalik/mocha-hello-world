In this project we are going to use mochajs as testing framework and chai as assertion library


some definitions for general concept:

## Mocha:
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.

## testing framework:
A testing framework or more specifically a testing automation framework is an. execution environment for automated tests. It is the overall system in which the. tests will be automated.


## Chai:
Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

## Assertion:
An assertion is a boolean expression at a specific point in a program which will be true unless there is a bug in the program. A test assertion is defined as an expression, which encapsulates some testable logic specified about a target under test.

## Assertion libraries:
Assertion libraries are tools to verify that things are correct. This makes it a lot easier to test your code, so you don't have to do thousands of if statements. Example (using should.js and Node.js assert module): var output = mycode. doSomething(); output.

## BDD testing:
BDD – Behavior-Driven Development – is perhaps the biggest source of confusion. When applied to automated testing, BDD is a set of best practices for writing great tests. BDD can, and should be, used together with TDD and unit testing methods.



## TDD testing:
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test
